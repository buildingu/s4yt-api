## Updates for this year's event
We have some updates about the timing for this year's event:
This year, the high school intern team is taking the lead in organizing the event. This will take a bit more time especially since we have a new design and new game features! We want to ensure that every detail is as perfect as possible, so we do not have a new date for $4YT 2023 yet, but we'll keep you informed every step of the way. This is an exciting time for us at building-U as student intern teams take on a new role in the event planning process. thereâ€™s still lots you can do.
