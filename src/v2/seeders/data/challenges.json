    "description": "At NeoNeo Surf, we currently make an assortment of surf/beach accessories (Variety of Bags/Pouches, Watch Cuffs, Journals, Sunglass Sleeves and Koozies) out of recycled wetsuits, aka neoprene.  We like designing and making things that are  functional, stylish and sustainably-minded. My challenge is for you to reimagine one of these items (or make up your own) through your unique vision and submit it in 2 ways.\n1. in words: in a short paragraph, describe what it is and how to use it. explain why you chose to make it and how you would market your idea to your community.\n2. visually: sew, draw or sketch it and include a photo of the visual\n\nNote: you must use neoprene as your base material - if anything else (beside a zipper or clasp) is added, it must also be a recycled product\n\nHave fun and be creative!\n\nIf chosen, we will bring your design to life and name the collection after you (eg: The Holly Collection).",
