    "question": "Neoprene, or wetsuit material, is exceptionally bad for the environment because:",
    "answers": {
      "choices": {
        "a": "It's very expensive to make and thus consumer-unfriendly.",
        "b": "There are artificial polymers in neoprene, making it non-biodegradable and non-compostable.",
        "c": "It's made in a factory overseas."
      },
      "correct": "b",
      "explanation": "Bummer, but even when a neoprene product rides its last wave, it still wreaks havoc on the environment. Made with synthetic polymers, neoprene doesn’t break down or compost, taking up to 100 years to eventually break down and releasing toxic chemicals into landfills—it can linger in landfills for centuries. Additionally, Neoprene is made from chloroprene, a petrochemical compound, which means its production depends on petroleum—a non-renewable resource."

        "c": "Recycling happens only at the Recycling Center."
      },
      "correct": "a",
      "explanation": "Upcycling, and thus re-using the already existing materials,  is actually considered the best form of Recycling there is because it involves the least amount of processing and re-manufacturing. Fewer pollutants and least waste combined with promoting a circular economy is the way to be!"

      "correct": "c",
      "explanation": "Bet this one surprised you. Wetsuits and neoprene cast offs are seriously stacking up—around 16 million pounds of neoprene gets ditched every year. That’s more than 5 million wetsuits clogging up landfills—pretty gnarly for the planet!"

    "question": "Why is it so hard to keep a satellite’s camera cool in space?",
    "answers": {
      "choices": {
        "a": "There is no air in space to carry heat away, so heat stays trapped.",
        "b": "The satellite is always facing towards the Sun.",
        "c": "Space is too cold for cooling systems to work."
      },
      "correct": "a",
      "explanation": "On Earth, heat can move through air — like how a fan cools you down. But space is a vacuum, which means heat has no air to travel through. So once something heats up, it stays hot unless you have a way to release that heat using special systems."

        "a": "Transparent glass shields.",
        "b": "Reflective materials like silver-coated foil.",
        "c": "Thick plastic layers surrounding it."
      },
      "correct": "b",
      "explanation": "Space engineers often use shiny, reflective materials, like silver or gold foil, because they bounce sunlight away from the satellite. This helps keep the inside of the satellite from heating up too quickly when exposed to the Sun.3. Why might your satellite’s camera still overheat even if it’s protected from the Sun’s heat? a. The camera keeps producing heat while it's taking pictures. (Correct) b. The protective material around it starts to melt in space. c. The satellite isn’t moving fast enough. Explanation: Cameras and electronics generate their own heat while working — especially when taking lots of pictures or processing data. That means even without sunlight, parts inside the satellite can overheat unless that heat is removed."

        "c": "The soil’s capacity to allow water to run off its surface quickly."
      },
      "correct": "a",
      "explanation": "Soil health matters as healthy soils lead to better crop growth, less fertilizers, good soil structure to withstand erosion, living roots and organic matter to help capture and store carbon and helps with reclaiming disturbed or salty soils impacted by historical oil and gas activity."

    "answers": {
      "choices": {
        "a": "No, every act is reversible, as long as the person wants to reverse it.",
        "b": "Yes, every act is irreversible; one cannot 'unact' an action.",
        "c": "Some acts are reversible, and some are irreversible."
      },
      "correct": "b",
      "explanation": "Anything done to 'reverse' an action would be another action, and may even be labelled a 're-action.' Sometimes this reality is expressed via the image of trying to put toothpaste back into a tube.  \"Unact\" is not found in conventional dictionaries of the English language, and \"unacted\" describes the absence of an action; an action that has not been performed, rather than an action being undone.  (More information can be found in Hanah Arendt's The Human Condition, pages 236-243 of the second edition.)"

        "a": "They are the same thing.",

        "c": "You may forgive someone and choose not to reconcile with them."
      },
      "correct": "c",
      "explanation": "\"Forgiveness is the act of granting a free pardon... for an offense or debt... the cost or penalty for a wrong is... borne by the forgiver and not by the one forgiven.\" (Dictionary of Scripture and Ethics, edited by Joel B. Green) Because forgiveness acts in an unexpected way, it is not merely a re-action, but a new action \"unconditioned by the act that provoked it... and frees from its consequences both the one who forgives and the one who is forgiven.\" (Hannah Arendt, as above) Reconciliation involves a resumption of relationship between the forgiver and the forgiven. Forgiveness is often needed for reconciliation to occur, but there is no requirement that reconciliation must follow after forgiveness; one may forgive and choose not to reconcile."

    "answers": {
      "choices": {
        "a": "Retributive justice seeks to punish wrongdoing by imposing penalties; restorative justice seeks to repair harm and promote reconciliation.",
        "b": "Retributive justice takes an adversarial approach; restorative justice takes a collaborative approach.",
        "c": "Both of the statements are accurate descriptions."
      },
      "correct": "c",
      "explanation": "Both types of justice seek to deter further wrongdoing, but they go about it very differently.  With retributive justice,  the victim's and the community's role is limited to witness and testimony. With restorative justice, the victim and the community play a much wider role through dialogue with the offender.  The goal of the dialogue is understanding and empathy, and creating an opportunity for the offender to be accountable for their actions, to make amends, and to rejoin the community."
